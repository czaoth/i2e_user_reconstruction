  Abstract                 = {A large number of vision applications rely on matching keypoints across images. The last decade featured an arms-race towards faster and more robust keypoints and association algorithms: Scale Invariant Feature Transform ({SIFT)}, Speed-up Robust Feature ({SURF)}, and more recently Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints ({BRISK)} to name a few. These days, the deployment of vision algorithms on smart phones and embedded devices with low memory and computation complexity has even upped the ante: the goal is to make descriptors faster to compute, more compact while remaining robust to scale, rotation and noise. To best address the current requirements, we propose a novel keypoint descriptor inspired by the human visual system and more precisely the retina, coined Fast Retina Keypoint ({FREAK).} A cascade of binary strings is computed by efficiently comparing image intensities over a retinal sampling pattern. Our experiments show that {FREAKs} are in general faster to compute with lower memory load and also more robust than {SIFT}, {SURF} or {BRISK.} They are thus competitive alternatives to existing keypoints in particular for embedded applications.},

We report our experiences in designing complex mixed-reality collaboration, control, and display systems for a real-world factory, for delivering real-time factory information to multiple types of users. In collaboration with TCHO, a chocolate maker in San Francisco, our research group is building a virtual "mirror" world of a real-world chocolate factory and its processes. Sensor data is imported into the multi-user 3D environment from hundreds of sensors on the factory floor. The resulting "virtual factory" is designed for simulation, visualization, and collaboration, using a set of interlinked, real-time layers of information about the factory and its processes. We are also looking at appropriate industrial uses for mobile devices such as cell phones and tablet computers, and how they intersect with virtual worlds and mixed realities. For example, an experimental iPhone web app provides mobile laboratory monitoring and control. The mobile system is integrated with the database underlying the virtual factory world. These systems were deployed at the real-world factory and lab in 2009, and are now in beta development. Through this mashup of mobile, social, mixed and virtual technologies, we hope to create industrial systems for enhanced collaboration between physically remote people and places - for example, factories in China with managers in Japan or the US.},

We use image processing software and finger- and hand-based fiducial markers to track gestures from the user, stencil buffering to enable the user to see their fingers at all times, and fingertip-based haptic feedback devices to enable the user to feel virtual objects. Unlike previous {AR} interfaces, this approach allows users to interact with virtual content using natural hand gestures. The paper describes how these techniques were applied in an urban planning interface, and also presents preliminary informal usability results.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Augmented reality (AR), a state-of-the-art technology for superimposing information onto the real world, has recently started to affect our daily lives. \{AR\} applications are becoming mature and versatile. This paper discusses trends in \{AR\} applications for architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM). This paper specifically focuses on four technologies‚Äîlocalization, natural user interface (NUI), cloud computing, and mobile devices‚Äîwhich have the potential to influence the development of \{AR\} applications. Advances in localization technology will enable the deployment of \{AR\} in a complex environment. An \{NUI\} provides more convenient and intuitive user experiences, which can increase the usability of AR. Cloud computing environments allow users with internet access to ubiquitously retrieve information from almost anywhere. Hence, cloud computing increases the freedom of using \{AR\} in AEC/FM applications. Another factor that will lead to the wider usage of \{AR\} is that mobile devices are becoming smaller, more powerful, and less expensive. This paper summarizes the results of 101 research efforts, and outlines the research trends and opportunities for applying \{AR\} in the fields of AEC/FM. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents research leading to the development of a visionbased gesture recognition system. The system comprises of three abstract layers each with their own specific type and requirements of data. The first layer is the skin detection layer. This component provides a set of disperse skin pixels for a tracker that forms the second layer. The second component is based on the Mean-shift algorithm which has been improved for robustness against noise using our novel fuzzy-based edge estimation method making the tracker suitable for real world applications. The third component is the gesture recognition layer which is based on a gesture modeling technique and artificial neural-networks for classification of the gesture.},

Die Analyse erfolgt mit Hilfe einer Testworkbench welche die Grundlage f√ºr alle weiteren Betrachtungen bildet. Im Anschluss wird ein Verfahren vorgestellt, mit dem die w√§hrend der Analyse erkannten problematischen Eigenschaften der Hardware kompensiert werden sollen. Das erarbeitete Verfahren wird im Rahmen einer Testanwendung eingesetzt und durch einen Usability-Test auf seine praktischen Auswirkungen auf die Eingabequalit√§t f√ºr den Anwender untersucht. Abschlie√üend werden die Ergebnisse des Tests ausgewertet sowie m√∂gliche Verbesserungen f√ºr zuk√ºnftige Arbeiten diskutiert.},

The simulation environment and the actual simulations can be efficiently distributed with a single compact file. Our proposed approach facilitates easy regeneration of published results, hereby highlighting the value of reproducible research.}},

It recognizes the movement and click gesture by analyzing the location and shape change of fingertips. The proposed system is applied to play game ‚ÄúAngry Birds‚Äù instead of mouse and keyboard.

  Abstract                 = {We present a systematic study on the recognition of 3D gestures using spatially convenient input devices. Specifically, we examine the linear acceleration-sensing Nintendo Wii Remote coupled with the angular velocity-sensing Nintendo Wii MotionPlus. For the study, we created a 3D gesture database, collecting data on 25 distinct gestures totalling 8500 gestures samples. Our experiment explores how the number of gestures and the amount of gestures samples used to train two commonly used machine learning algorithms, a linear and AdaBoost classifier, affect overall recognition accuracy. We examined these gesture recognition algorithms with user dependent and user independent training approaches and explored the affect of using the Wii Remote with and without the Wii MotionPlus attachment. Our results show that in the user dependent case, both the Ad-aBoost and linear classification algorithms can recognize up to 25 gestures at over 90% accuracy, with 15 training samples per gesture, and up to 20 gestures at over 90% accuracy, with only five training samples per gesture. In particular, all 25 gestures could be recognized at over 99% accuracy with the linear classifier using 15 training samples per gesture, with the Wii Remote coupled with the Wii MotionPlus. In addition, both algorithms can recognize up to nine gestures at over 90% accuracy using a user independent training database with 100 samples per gesture. The Wii MotionPlus attachment played a significant role in improving accuracy in both the user dependent and independent cases.},

  Abstract                 = {The primary goal of pattern recognition is supervised or unsupervised classification. Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated, the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently, neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well-known methods used in various stages of a pattern recognition system and identify research topics and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field},

  Abstract                 = {Real-time or online 3D reconstruction has wide applicability and receives further interest due to availability of consumer depth cameras. Typical approaches use a moving sensor to accumulate depth measurements into a single model which is continuously refined. Designing such systems is an intricate balance between reconstruction quality, speed, spatial scale, and scene assumptions. Existing online methods either trade scale to achieve higher quality reconstructions of small objects/scenes. Or handle larger scenes by trading real-time performance and/or quality, or by limiting the bounds of the active reconstruction. Additionally, many systems assume a static scene, and cannot robustly handle scene motion or reconstructions that evolve to reflect scene changes. We address these limitations with a new system for real-time dense reconstruction with equivalent quality to existing online methods, but with support for additional spatial scale and robustness in dynamic scenes. Our system is designed around a simple and flat point-Based representation, which directly works with the input acquired from range/depth sensors, without the overhead of converting between representations. The use of points enables speed and memory efficiency, directly leveraging the standard graphics pipeline for all central operations, i.e., camera pose estimation, data association, outlier removal, fusion of depth maps into a single denoised model, and detection and update of dynamic objects. We conclude with qualitative and quantitative results that highlight robust tracking and high quality reconstructions of a diverse set of scenes at varying scales.},

  Abstract                 = {Physicians are accustomed to using volumetric datasets for medical assessment, diagnosis and treatment. These modalities can be displayed with {3D} computer visualizations for physicians to study the overall shape and internal anatomical structures. Gesture-based interfaces can be beneficial to interact with these kinds of visualizations in a variety of medical settings. We conducted two user studies that explore different gesture-based interfaces for interaction with volume visualizations. The first experiment focused on rotation tasks, where the performance of the gesture-based interface (using Microsoft Kinect) was compared to using the mouse. The second experiment studied localization of internal structures, comparing slice-based visualizations via gestures and the mouse, in addition to a {3D} Magic Lens visualization. The results of the user studies showed that the gesture-based interface outperformed the traditional mouse both in time and accuracy in the orientation matching task. The traditional mouse was the better interface for the second experiment in terms of accuracy. However, the gesture-based Magic Lens was found to have the fastest target localization time. We discuss these findings and their further implications in the use of gesture-based interfaces in medical volume visualization.},

SpaceTop allows users to type, click, draw in 2D, and directly manipulate interface elements that float in the 3D space above the keyboard. It makes it possible to easily switch from one modality to another, or to simultaneously use two modalities with different hands. We introduce hardware and software configurations for co-locating these various interaction modalities in a unified workspace using depth cameras and a transparent display. We describe new interaction and visualization techniques that allow users to interact with 2D elements floating in 3D space and present the results from a preliminary user study that indicates the benefit of such hybrid workspaces.},

  Abstract                 = {Virtual worlds use simulation to create a fully-immersive 3D space in which users interact and collaborate in real time. It is still a great challenge to scale virtual worlds to provide rich user experiences, high level of realism, and innovative usages. There are three unique simulation requirements in scaling virtual worlds: (1) large-scale, real time and perpetual simulations with distributed interaction, (2) simultaneous visualization for many endpoints with unique perspectives, and (3) multiple simulation engines with different operation characteristics. In this paper, we review the challenges in meeting these requirements, present the scalability barriers we observed in current virtual worlds, and discuss potential virtual world architecture and solutions to address the challenges and overcome the barriers.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel method for video-based head gesture recognition using eye information by an eye tracker has been proposed. The method uses a combination of gaze and eye movement to infer head gestures. Compared to other gesture-based methods a major advantage of the method is that the user keeps the gaze on the interaction object while interacting. This method has been implemented on a head-mounted eye tracker for detecting a set of predefined head gestures. The accuracy of the gesture classifier is evaluated and verified for gaze-based interaction in applications intended for both large public displays and small mobile phone screens. The user study shows that the method detects a set of defined gestures reliably.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, human - machine interaction ({HMI)} becomes a hot research topic because of its wide applications, ranging from automatic device control to designing and development of assistant robot or even smart building at sparser scale. One of the most important questions in this research field is finding out an efficient and natural method of {HMI.} Among several channels of communication, hand gestures have been shown to be an intuitive and efficient mean to express an idea or to control something. For a successful hand gesture based interaction between human and robot, a vocabulary of hand gestures needs to be defined. To resolve this problem, in this paper, we propose a framework to study the behavior of Vietnamese in using of hand gesture in communication with robot. This study allows designing a hand gesture vocabulary for human - robot interaction ({HRI)} applications. In the literature, there are no works similar to ours. This makes our twofold contributions: (1) a proposed framework for hand gesture recognition: hand gesture vocabulary design, feature extraction for hand posture representation, hand posture classification, and hand gesture database construction; (2) some experimentations are realized to evaluate the defined hand gesture set that can be used in general situation of {HRI.} The experiment results show that the defined hand gesture set satisfies the both criteria: intuitiveness and recognisability.},

title={The virtual chocolate factory: Building a real world mixed-reality system for industrial collaboration and control},
year={2010},
month={July},
pages={1160-1165},
abstract={Virtual, mobile, and mixed reality systems have diverse uses for data visualization and remote collaboration in industrial settings, especially factories. We report our experiences in designing complex mixed-reality collaboration, control, and display systems for a real-world factory, for delivering real-time factory information to multiple types of users. In collaboration with TCHO, a chocolate maker in San Francisco, our research group is building a virtual "mirror" world of a real-world chocolate factory and its processes. Sensor data is imported into the multi-user 3D environment from hundreds of sensors on the factory floor. The resulting "virtual factory" is designed for simulation, visualization, and collaboration, using a set of interlinked, real-time layers of information about the factory and its processes. We are also looking at appropriate industrial uses for mobile devices such as cell phones and tablet computers, and how they intersect with virtual worlds and mixed realities. For example, an experimental iPhone web app provides mobile laboratory monitoring and control. The mobile system is integrated with the database underlying the virtual factory world. These systems were deployed at the real-world factory and lab in 2009, and are now in beta development. Through this mashup of mobile, social, mixed and virtual technologies, we hope to create industrial systems for enhanced collaboration between physically remote people and places - for example, factories in China with managers in Japan or the US.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses challenges and opportunities in engineering education, in particular in the area of control and automation, that have been made possible through advanced IT systems and Internet. The paper reviews different types of didactic plants that evolved hands-on and simulated labs, both local as remotely accessed, to mixed reality and virtual world labs, where student avatars are used to increase the sense of reality and promote collaboration. As experience shows that alone the use of such didactic plants is not enough to ensure success in the learning process and that their integration into e-learning environments is important, the main characteristics of Computer Supported Collaborative Environments (CSCE) are discussed and some relevant initiatives in this area are reviewed. The paper also describes an e-learning system developed by the authors, which has been successfully applied to several automation engineering courses in Brazil.},

This paper provides an expanded foundation for future research by presenting a statistical review of augmented reality technology in the AEC industry. The review is based on articles found within eight well-known journals in architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM) until the end of the year 2012. The review further narrows the literature within these journals by considering only those 133 articles found through a key word search for "augmented reality." The selected journal articles are classified within the following dimensions: improvement focus, industry sector, target audience, project phase, stage of technology maturity, application area, comparison role, and technology. The number of articles within these dimensions are used to identify maturing and emerging trends in the literature as well as to synthesize the current state-of-the-art of augmented reality research in the AEC industry. In summary, the AR literature has increasingly focused on the demonstration of visualization and simulation applications for comparison of as-planned versus as-built statuses of the project during the construction phase to monitor project progress and address issues faced by field workers. In addition, the future trend is toward using web-based mobile augmented systems for field construction monitoring.},

  Abstract                 = {For a successful real-time vision-based HCI system, inference from natural visual method is crucial. In this paper, we have aimed to provide interaction through gesture and posture recognition for alphabets and numbers. In addition, data fusion is carried out which integrates these systems to extract multiple meanings at the same time. 3D information is exploited for segmentation and detection of face and hands using normal Gaussian distribution and depth information. For gesture, orientation of two consecutive hand centroid points is computed which is then quantized to generate code words. HMM is trained by Baum Welch algorithm and classified by Viterbi path algorithm. In posture recognition, American Sign Language is recognized for static alphabets and numbers. Feature vectors are computed from statistical and geometrical properties of the hand and are used to train SVM for classification and recognition. Moreover, curvature analysis is carried out for alphabets to avoid misclassifications. Experimental results of the proposed framework successfully integrate both gesture and posture recognition system at decision level fusion whereas the gesture system achieves recognition rate of 98% (i.e. for alphabets and numbers) and the posture recognition system with recognition rates of 98.65% and 98.6% for ASL alphabets and numbers respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {Hand gesture based Human-Computer-Interaction ({HCI)} is one of the most natural and intuitive ways to communicate between people and machines, since it closely mimics how human interact with each other. In this demo, we present a hand gesture recognition system with Kinect sensor, which operates robustly in uncontrolled environments and is insensitive to hand variations and distortions. Our system consists of two major modules, namely, hand detection and gesture recognition. Different from traditional vision-based hand gesture recognition methods that use color-markers for hand detection, our system uses both the depth and color information from Kinect sensor to detect the hand shape, which ensures the robustness in cluttered environments. Besides, to guarantee its robustness to input variations or the distortions caused by the low resolution of Kinect sensor, we apply a novel shape distance metric called Finger-Earth Mover's Distance ({FEMD)} for hand gesture recognition. Consequently, our system operates accurately and efficiently. In this demo, we demonstrate the performance of our system in two real-life applications, arithmetic computation and rock-paper-scissors game.},

Current methods rely on costly descriptors for detection and matching. In this paper, we propose a very fast binary descriptor based on {BRIEF}, called {ORB}, which is rotation invariant and resistant to noise. We demonstratethrough experiments how {ORB} is at two orders of magnitude faster than {SIFT}, while performing as well in many situations. The efficiency is tested on several real-world applications, including object detection and patch-tracking on a smart phone.},

  Abstract                 = {To enhance a hand gesture recognition system, we compare performance in accordance with various parameters. We present an efficient framework for gesture recognition that can be easily implemented with low computational costs. Based on the simple K-{NN} classifier, we develop a pattern matching method through combining the Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW)} alignment and distance measure for similarity between two sequences. In this process, we extract various features of hand and apply various distance measure for similarity. In addition to the gesture features and distance measures, we proposed preprocessing method to enhance the performance.},

  Abstract                 = {The main contribution of this paper is a probabilistic method for predicting human manipulation intention from image sequences of human-object interaction. Predicting intention amounts to inferring the imminent manipulation task when human hand is observed to have stably grasped the object. Inference is performed by means of a probabilistic graphical model that encodes object grasping tasks over the 3D state of the observed scene. The 3D state is extracted from RGB-D image sequences by a novel vision-based, markerless hand-object 3D tracking framework. To deal with the high-dimensional state-space and mixed data types (discrete and continuous) involved in grasping tasks, we introduce a generative vector quantization method using mixture models and self-organizing maps. This yields a compact model for encoding of grasping actions, able of handling uncertain and partial sensory data. Experimentation showed that the model trained on simulated data can provide a potent basis for accurate goal-inference with partial and noisy observations of actual real-world demonstrations. We also show a grasp selection process, guided by the inferred human intention, to illustrate the use of the system for goal-directed grasp imitation.},

In this paper, a novel hand gesture recognition system is presented. To detect the exact hand target from complicate scenarios, the color and motion clues are used to obtain potential hand regions. And then a method named Motion Times Image ({MTI)} is proposed to identify the optimal hand location. The R-transform descriptor is used to describe the hand shape features and an offline trained Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function kernels ({RBF-SVM)} is exploited to perform the hand gesture recognition task. Extensive experiments with different users under dynamic and complicate scenarios are conducted to show its high recognition accuracy and strong robustness.},

  Abstract                 = {Existing wearable hand gesture interaction devices are very bulky and cannot be worn in everyday life, because of the presence of a large visual feedback device. In particular, an eyeglass-type head-mounted display is very large for constant usage. To solve this problem, we propose Brainy Hand, which is a simple wearable device that adopts laser line, or more specifically, a mini-projector as a visual feedback device. Brainy Hand consists of a color camera, an earphone, and a laser line or mini-projector. This device uses a camera to detect {3D} hand gestures. The earphone is used for receiving audio feedback. In this study, we introduce several user interfaces using Brainy Hand. (e.g., music player, phone)},

  Abstract                 = {We present a computer vision technique to detect when the user brings their thumb and forefinger together (a pinch gesture) for close-range and relatively controlled viewing circumstances. The technique avoids complex and fragile hand tracking algorithms by detecting the hole formed when the thumb and forefinger are touching; this hole is found by simple analysis of the connected components of the background segmented against the hand. Our Thumb and Fore-Finger Interface ({TAFFI)} demonstrates the technique for cursor control as well as map navigation using one and two-handed interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a {2D} motion detection bounded hand {3D} trajectory tracking and gesture recognition system is proposed for virtual reality interactions. First, the Bayes decision rule for classification of background and foreground is utilized to automatically locate the hand that bounded within a rectangle, and then the trajectory of the hand in {3D} space is tracked by mean shift particle filter and stereo imaging. The skin color feature is exploited for image matting that effectively segment the hand contour in video sequence automatically. Finally the hand gesture is recognized by the connected component analysis and line approximation. The proposed technique works without any markers or constraints, overcomes the disturbance of arms and faces in the scene, and can recognize multiple hands with different gestures under complex background.},

In such situation, a gesture is one of powerful methods as input method because it needs no physical devices to touch and a user can input quickly. However, there are various restrictions for gesture input in daily life; gestures must be socially acceptable because a user has to gesture with unusual movements in a crowd, gestures must be flexible because a user cannot gesture when he/she has a bag with his hand that is used for a gesture. In this paper, we clarify the restrictions on gesture interfaces in daily life, then propose practical gestures for selecting simple menu items with hands and feet.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a mixed hand gesture interaction system in virtual environment, in which "mixed" means static and dynamic hand gestures are combined for both navigation and object manipulation. Firstly, a simple average background model and skin color are used for hand area segmentation. Then a state-based spotting algorithm is employed to automatically identify two types of hand gestures. A voting-based method is used for quick classification of static gestures. And we use the hidden Markov model ({HMM)} to recognize dynamic gestures. Since the training of {HMM} requires the consistency of the training data, outputted by the feature extraction, a data aligning algorithm is raised. Through our mixed hand gesture system, users can perform complicated operating commands in a natural way. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods are effective and accurate.},

  Abstract                 = {As a certain case in the domain of human actions, hand gestures can be expressed by the motion of user's hand to provide nature interaction information in many applications. This paper proposed a hand gesture recognition system based on sparse {3D} interest point detector, the spatial-temporal filtering achieved by separable linear Gaussian-Gabor filters detects local motion corners as strong response. The motion trajectory is extracted from the response and different feature formulations are introduced for gesture classification with several solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that the trajectory feature from spatial-temporal ({ST)} filtering is more reliable than cuboids descriptor, and {SVM} overcomes {KNN} and {HMM} for classification.},
